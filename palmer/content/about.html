											<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
											<p>digital artist and designer</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											Graphic design and digital illustration are the tools I use to perceive what I call “the edge.”
I define “the edge” as Avant Garde stylized design, structured in a modernized system. My inspiration bleeds off urban culture and pop surrealism.

												Brandon Palmer grew up around the East Coast skateboarding culture. He spent most of his time filming, competing, and skateboarding with professionals such as Donny Barley and Brandon Westgate. Ever since he was little, he hungered to be part of the skate industry, even if he wasn’t skating professionally. At the age of eleven, this was realized when he was photographed in the March 2005 issue of Thrasher Magazine. Since then Brandon has skated under sponsorships including, Worship Skateboards, Riptide Skateboards, and the Hive to compete and advertise for their brands. The experience was thrilling. Putting all his
creativity, energy, focus, and passion into the lifestyle made Brandon feel that he had been helping a small portion of the skate culture stay alive.
Through the support of his sponsorships, Palmer started to gravitate towards the artistic aspects of modern culture, striving to brand himself as a skateboarding icon through design. During a 2012 trip to Los Angeles, Palmer filmed multiple clips that were featured in the Worship Skateboard film “Steak and Cheese.” While there, Palmer became deeply drawn to the California urban culture and architectural design elements. The hot-rods, murals, graffiti, and oceans Palmer was surrounded by, sparked his interest as a designer. After absorbing these West Coast concepts, Brandon wanted to bring that vibe to the East Coast through graphic design. Palmer loves to create lowbrow art that breaths deep emotion and meaning into his work; whether it is illustration, photography, or writing music. Creating artwork gives Brandon the same free flow feeling as skateboarding does.
